(set: $typewriterText to &quot;Dear Body, 


I probably won’t send this but I am currently sitting 
in front of the mirror on the bathroom floor thinking about our relationship. 
I don’t even know how many days I have spent sat here like this, 
but the shadows are doing scary things to our reflection.  

I nearly had a head on collision this morning. 
I wouldn’t call it an accident though, since we’ve
been on this crash course for a while now-you and me.
Sorry for the bumps and bruises I was just testing out that
&#39;extra padding&#39; we put on over Christmas.

Speaking of, please don&#39;t take the scissors personally,
I just can&#39;t afford to take us to the butchers right now and
my hairdresser refuses to trim you up. She thinks I am too
harsh when I ask for a &#39;little off the sides&#39;,
but she just doesn&#39;t see you the way I do...

...or understand that I wish I couldn&#39;t see you at all.

That is why I pay to watch myself in her mirror for a few hours,
just for that off chance that if I stare hard or long enough, you
will give up and disappear forever.

But I keep coming home to find you waiting here in the bathroom. 


Anyway, I think we need to call the plumber, I&#39;ve become unhinged again.


Yours, Mind
